## About

[VideoDownloadTool.io](//VideoDownloadTool.io) makes it easy to download videos--but only the parts you want. Enter a video's url, select the beginning and end of your clip, optionally crop the video frame, and download.

I created this tool because I often wanted to create short clips to share, and it was time consuming to first download the video and then make manual edits. It's saved me a ton of time and I hope it can do the same for you.

### Built With

* Vanilla JS
* [`nanohtml`](https://github.com/choojs/nanohtml#readme) and [`nanomorph`](https://github.com/choojs/nanomorph#readme)
* [`wildemitter`](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/wildemitter#readme) (Node.js-style Event Emitters)
* [Tachyons](//tachyons.io) for style

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This repo is for the **Video Download Tool UI**. You can use the hosted version at [VideoDownloadTool.io](//VideoDownloadTool.io). For best results set up your own [Video Download Tool Server](//github.com/davidguttman/video-download-tool-server), but for demo purposes you can use [video-download-tool.herokuapp.com](https://video-download-tool.herokuapp.com).

### Installation

To run the Video Download Tool locally:

* Clone this repo
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

This should start the UI running at [localhost:9966](http://localhost:9966). To connect it to a [Video Download Tool Server](//github.com/davidguttman/video-download-tool-server) visit `http://localhost:9966/?host=$server` where `$server` is the host of the Video Download Tool server you would like to connect to (e.g. `?host=video-download-tool.herokuapp.com`).

## Usage

Once connected to a [Video Download Tool Server](//github.com/davidguttman/video-download-tool-server):

1. Paste in the URL of a video you would like to download
2. Seek to the place you want your download video to start from and click "Set Start Time"
3. Seek to the place you want your downloaded video to end and click "Set End Time"
4. If you'd like to crop the video to a portion of the frame, click "Crop" and drag over the video player to highlight the portion you'd like to crop to
5. Click "Download" to download the trimmed and cropped video
